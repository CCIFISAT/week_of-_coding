			<br><br>
				<p><h2>London</h2>
				<br><br>
				The clock inside the tower was the world's largest when it was installed in the middle of the nineteenth century.
				The name Big Ben actually refers to the clock's hour bell, the largest of the clock's five bells. The other four are used as quarter bells.

		do not want to visit this world famous structure, you will see its top from all over Paris. The tower rises 300 meters
		tall (984 ft); when it was completed at the end of the nineteenth century it was twice as high as the Washington Monument, at the
		time the tallest structure in the world.
